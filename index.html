<h1>About Me</h1>

<p style="font-size:18px">
    I am an MS student in the Robotics Department at the University of Michigan (<a href="https://robotics.umich.edu/" target="_blank">UMich</a>), focusing on learning-based robot control i.e. <b>reinforcement learning</b>, and perception for enhanced <b>scene understanding</b> at the ROAHM lab with Professor <a href="https://www.roahmlab.com/ram-personal" target="_blank">Ram Vasudevan</a> and Dr. Elena Shrestha. I previously interned at the Biorobotics Lab at Carnegie Mellon University (<a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">CMU</a>), where I collaborated with <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/howie-choset/" target="_blank">Dr. Howie Choset</a> and <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/matthew-j-travers/" target="_blank">Dr. Matthew Travers</a>. Before that, I earned my bachelorâ€™s degree from the Birla Institute of Technology & Science (<a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad" target="_blank">BITS Pilani</a>), majoring in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Robotics and Automation, under the guidance of Professor Arshad Javed, where I gained valuable experience in classical control of robot manipulators and learning-based control of UAVs.

<p style="font-size:18px">
I have a strong interest in <b>SLAM</b>, <b>state estimation</b>, and <b>motion planning</b> for mobile robots, skills developed through various projects, including those advised by <a href="https://robotics.umich.edu/profile/maani-ghaffari/" target="_blank">Dr. Maani Ghaffari</a>, whose classes significantly advanced my expertise. 
</p>

<p style="font-size:18px">
I am also passionate about applying <b>machine learning and computer vision tools</b> to diverse fields beyond robotics, such as healthcare and visual content generation.
Outside of technology, I enjoy playing lawn tennis, and watching movies.

<!-- <p style="font-size:18px">
    I am particularly interested in <b>robot learning</b> and <b>scene understanding</b>, and proficient in developing robotic algorithms.
    When I'm not immersed in technology, you can find me playing lawn tennis, and watching movies.
